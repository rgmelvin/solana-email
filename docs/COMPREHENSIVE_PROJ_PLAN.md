## Overview

The **Solana Web3 Email Service** is a decentralized email system built on the Solana blockchain with the Anchor framework. It provides functionalities for user registration, profile management, and secure email messaging with spam deterrence mechanisms. The project is designed to be scalable, secure, and interoperable with other chains while offering a polished user experience.

## Project Phases and Objectives

### Phase 1: Foundation & Core Functionality (Weeks 1-4)

**Objectives**
  - **Smart Contract Development**:
    - Design and implement the core Solana program (smart contract) for user registration and profile management using Program Derived Addresses (PDAs).
    - Implement basic instruction for:
      - ```registerUser``` (creating a PDA-based user profile)
      - ```updateUser``` (updating profile information, e.g., display name)
      - ```unregisterUser``` (closing the progile and reclaiming lamports)
      - ```sendEmail``` (recording email metadata with a spam prevention deposit)

  - **Testing & CI/CD**:
    - Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests.
    - Establish an automated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

  - **Documentation**:
    - Write a README, Developer Guide, and Security Guide.

    - Enhance the registration process to include public key registration for encryption.
  
  - **Advanced Security**:
    - Implement additional security constraints (e.g., custom error codes for unauthorized actions).
    - Conduct thorough internal security reviews and static analysis.

  - **Tokenomics & Spam Prevention**:
    - Develop a rewards system that incentivizes good behaviour and penalizes spam through small token-based deposits.
    - Update the smart contract to handle token rewards and penalties.

**Deliverables**:
  - Updated on-chain program with encryption hooks and enhanced security checks.
  - Client-side encryption module.
  - Tokenomics model documentation.

    - Enable sending and receiving messages or transferring tokens across blockchains.

  - **Decentralized Storage Integration**:
    - Integrate with decentralized storage networks (e.g., Arweave, IPFS, Metaplex) for off-chain storage of large email content and attachments.

  - **Ecosystem Expansion**:
    - Expand the protocol to support additional features (e.g., decentralized identity verification, multi-chain rewards).

**Deliverables**:
  - Prototype cross-chain functionality.

## Architecture Overview

The project is architected with a clear separation between on-chain and off-chain components:

  - **On-Chain Program**:
    Written in Rust using Anchor, it manages PDA, user registration, profile updates, unregistration, and email sending with spam prevention deposits.
  - **Client Integration**:
    A TypeScript-based client library facilitates communication with the on-chain program. this layer is responsible for PDA derivation, transaction creation, encryption/ decryption (Phase 2), and interfacing with decentralized storage (Phase 4).
  - **CI/CD Pipeline**:
    Automated workflows (using GitHub Actions) handle building, deploying, testing, linting, and static analysis for both Rust and TypeScript components.
  - **Encryption & Key Management (Phase 2)**:
    Client-side modules implement end-to-end encryption to protect email content. Only encrypted data or pointers to off-chain storage are stored on-chain.
  -**Cross-Chain Layer (Phase 4)**:
    Designed for future expansion, this layer will handle interoperabillity between Solana and other blockchain networks.

## Security and Quality Assurance

- **Security Model**:
  - Use strict account constraints and custom error codes (via ```#[error_code]```) to enforce proper authorization.
  - Ensure all PDAs are derived deterministically to prevent unauthorized access.

- **Static Analysis**:
  - Run [Cargo Clippy](https://doc.rust-lang.org/clippy/usage.html) for rust and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/) for TypeScript
  ```bash
  cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
  yarn eslint . --ext .ts
  ```

- **Testing Strategy**:
  - Develop unit tests and integration tests covering both positive and negative scenarios.
  - Use isolated keypairs per test to prevent state conflicts.
  - Incorporate tests for unauthorized access, duplicate registration, insufficient funds, and input boundary conditions.

- **External Audits**:
  - Prior to mainnet deployment, engage third-party auditors to review the smart contracts and client code.

## CI/CD, Testing & Documentation

- **CI/CD Integration**:
  - Use GitHub actions to automate building, deploying, and testing.
  - Enforce linting and static analysis in the CI pipeline.
  - Example workflow steps include checking out code, setting up toolchains, caching dependencies, installing CLI tools, building the program, and running tests.

- **Documentation**:
  - Maintain comprehensive developer documentation (this document, Developer Guide, and Security Guide) updated with every phase.
  - Generate and publish API references automatically using tools integrated into your workflow.

- **Changelog**:
  - Maintain a changelog file (e.g., ```CHANGELOG.md```) documenting all significant changes, but fixes, and feature updates. Each entry should include the date, version, and a brief description of changes.
